# Advent of Code 2020



The [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an annual programming challenge 
created by Eric Wastl.

_Spoilers Ahead_

It's fun and challenging as the tasks get progressively more difficult.  It's a great way to practice a 
new programming language, tool or technique. 

This repository contains my attempts to solve the 2020 puzzles.

For 2020, I'm doing the work in Python, using the PyCharm IDE
(which is new to me.)  And I'm using pytest to maintain unit tests for all the code.  (As I'm also
trying to develop some unit testing skills.)

_Spoiler Warning_: If you are interested in doing the challenges yourself, this repo may contain
spoilers.  Often, one day's solution builds on another's so you may be seeing
my repo in a state beyond where you're working at the moment.
